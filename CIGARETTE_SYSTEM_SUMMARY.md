# Cigarette Dual-Unit Inventory System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive dual-unit inventory system specifically for cigarette products with separate tracking for packs and loose pieces.

## Key Features

### 1. Dual-Unit Stock Tracking
- **Pack-based inventory**: Stock tracked per pack (20 pieces each)
- **Loose pieces**: Separate tracking for individual pieces
- **Auto-pack opening**: Configurable option to automatically open packs when loose pieces run out
- **Reorder levels**: Defined per pack for proper inventory management

### 2. Pricing System
- **Dual pricing**: Separate prices for packs and individual pieces
- **Flexible pricing**: Price per piece and price per pack independently set
- **Display format**: Shows both pricing options (e.g., "â‚±6.50/pc â€¢ â‚±130.00/pack")

### 3. Cart Management
- **Separate cart system**: `CigaretteCartItem` class for cigarette products
- **Dual quantity tracking**: Independent counters for packs and pieces
- **Smart validation**: Checks stock availability for both units before adding
- **Combined pricing**: Calculates total price from both pack and piece quantities

### 4. User Interface
- **Selection dialog**: When cigarette selected, user chooses pack or piece
- **Dual controls**: Separate +/- buttons for packs and pieces in cart
- **Stock display**: Shows "X packs + Y pcs" format
- **Visual indicators**: Icons differentiate between packs (ðŸ“¦) and pieces (â€¢)

### 5. Inventory Logic
- **Smart deduction**: 
  - Selling by pack deducts full packs
  - Selling by piece deducts loose pieces first
  - Auto-opens packs when loose pieces insufficient (if enabled)
- **Stock validation**: Prevents overselling with real-time availability checks
- **Low stock alerts**: Based on pack count vs reorder level

## Data Model

### Product Model Extensions
```dart
class Product {
  // Existing fields...
  int loosePieces;        // Available loose pieces
  int fullPacks;          // Available full packs  
  bool autoOpenPack;      // Auto-open pack setting
  
  // Methods
  bool canSellPieces(int quantity);
  bool canSellPacks(int quantity);
  void sellPieces(int quantity);
  void sellPacks(int quantity);
  String get stockDisplay; // "X packs + Y pcs"
}
```

### Cigarette Cart Item
```dart
class CigaretteCartItem {
  final Product product;
  int pieceQuantity;      // Pieces in cart
  int packQuantity;       // Packs in cart
  
  double get totalPrice;  // Combined price
  String get displayText; // "2 packs + 5 pcs"
}
```

## Database Schema Updates

### Version 4 Schema
```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN loosePieces INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN fullPacks INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN autoOpenPack INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
```
