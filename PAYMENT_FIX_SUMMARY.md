# Payment Processing Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Processing payment..." Hanging Issue
**Problem**: The payment processing dialog would hang and never close after confirming payment.

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing proper context checks when closing dialogs
- Race conditions in async operations
- Cart total being calculated after cart was cleared

**Solution**:
- Added `context.mounted` checks before Navigator operations
- Store total amount before clearing cart in `completeSale()`
- Proper error handling with context checks

### 2. Sales Not Appearing in Reports
**Problem**: Sales transactions were not being recorded in the database, so reports showed no data.

**Root Cause**:
- No sales table in database
- `completeSale()` method only updated inventory, didn't record sales
- Reports were showing mock/sample data instead of real sales

**Solution**:
- Added sales and sale_items tables to database (version 3)
- Updated `completeSale()` to record sale transactions
- Modified reports to use real sales data from database
- Added proper sales data aggregation for charts and top-selling items

### 3. Database Schema Updates
**Changes Made**:
- Upgraded database to version 3
- Added `sales` table with id, date, total
- Added `sale_items` table with sale details
- Added cigarette support columns (isCigarette, piecesPerPack, packPrice)

### 4. Code Changes

#### DatabaseService.dart
- Added sales table creation and management
- Added methods: `insertSale()`, `getAllSales()`, `getSalesInDateRange()`
- Updated product schema to support cigarette properties

#### AppProvider.dart
- Added sales list and loading
- Updated `completeSale()` to record sales transactions
- Added sales data reloading after successful transactions

#### POSScreen.dart
- Fixed payment confirmation dialog hanging
- Added proper context checks for dialog navigation
- Store total amount before cart clearing

#### ReportsScreen.dart
- Updated to use real sales data instead of mock data
- Added proper product emoji lookup for top-selling items
- Added empty state handling for no sales data
