# Batch Pricing and Payment Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Batch Pricing Logic ✅
- **Problem**: Cart pricing was messy for batch products - individual pricing was shown instead of batch-adjusted pricing
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated cart display to show proper batch pricing using `getPriceForQuantity()` method
  - Added batch increment logic for + and - buttons
  - For batch products, + and - buttons now increment by batch quantity (e.g., 3 pieces at a time)
  - Added visual indicator showing batch information (e.g., "Batch: 3pcs = ₱5.00")

### 2. Enhanced Payment Window ✅
- **Problem**: Payment window was basic with no input for payment amount or change calculation
- **Solution**:
  - Added payment amount input field with peso sign prefix
  - Real-time change calculation as user types
  - Payment validation:
    - Shows "Exact payment" for exact amounts
    - Shows change amount in green for overpayment
    - Shows "Insufficient payment" error with amount needed for underpayment
  - Transaction cannot proceed if payment is insufficient
  - Enhanced success dialog shows payment details including change

### 3. Philippine Peso Sign Display ✅
- **Problem**: Peso sign (₱) not showing properly in mobile app
- **Solution**:
  - Added font fallback support in theme configuration
  - Created `AppTheme.formatCurrency()` helper method for consistent currency formatting
  - Updated all currency displays throughout the app to use the helper method
  - Ensured Unicode support for peso sign (₱) character
