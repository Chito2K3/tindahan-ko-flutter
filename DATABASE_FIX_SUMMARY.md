# Database Persistence Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was not saving products to a persistent database. When users added new products and closed the app, the products would disappear on restart because they were only stored in memory.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Database Service (`lib/services/database_service.dart`)
- Added SQLite database integration using `sqflite` package
- Created `products` table with all necessary fields
- Implemented CRUD operations:
  - `insertProduct()` - Add new products
  - `getAllProducts()` - Load all products
  - `updateProduct()` - Update existing products
  - `deleteProduct()` - Remove products
  - `getProductByBarcode()` - Find products by barcode

### 2. Updated App Provider (`lib/providers/app_provider.dart`)
- Changed all product operations to async methods
- Added database persistence to:
  - `addProduct()` - Now saves to database
  - `updateProduct()` - Now updates database
  - `deleteProduct()` - Now removes from database
  - `completeSale()` - Now updates stock in database
- Added `loadProducts()` method to load from database on startup
- Added loading state management

### 3. Updated App Initialization (`lib/main.dart`)
- Modified `_InitialScreenState` to load products from database on startup
- Ensures database is initialized before navigating to main screens

### 4. Updated UI Components
- **Inventory Screen**: Added async/await and error handling for database operations
- **POS Screen**: Added async handling for completing sales
- **Home Screen**: Removed redundant sample data loading

## Key Features Added
- ✅ **Persistent Storage**: Products are now saved to SQLite database
- ✅ **Data Recovery**: Products persist across app restarts
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for database failures
- ✅ **Loading States**: UI shows loading while database operations occur
- ✅ **Sample Data**: Automatically loads sample products on first run

## Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  price REAL NOT NULL,
  stock INTEGER NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  emoji TEXT NOT NULL,
  reorderLevel INTEGER NOT NULL,
  hasBarcode INTEGER NOT NULL,
  barcode TEXT
)
```

## Testing Instructions
1. Run the app
2. Add a new product in the Inventory screen
3. Close the app completely
4. Reopen the app
5. Verify the product is still there

The database persistence issue has been completely resolved!
